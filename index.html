                    Bring back the youth in you, whether it be addressing a hormonal imbalance or enhancing your quality of life, My Compounding Pharmacy plays a vital role in managing men and women’s health for menopause, andropause or a simple hormone deficiency!
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    Our dedication to personalised solutions is a crucial aspect to maintaining a person’s well-being and our bioidentical hormones are the cornerstone of compounded hormone replacement therapy medications. These include one or a combination of estrone, estradiol, estriol, progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, 7-Keto-DHEA, and testosterone; to name a few, which; closely mirror your body’s natural hormones.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">WHY CHOOSE BIOIDENTICAL OVER SYNTHETIC HORMONES:</h3>
                <p>
                    One fundamental distinction in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the choice between bioidentical and synthetic hormones. Bioidentical hormones are structurally identical to the hormones produced naturally by our body. They are a primary choice for prescribers when synthetic hormones are not suitable or when the compatibility and similarity to your own hormones are more appropriate, to minimise potential side effects and risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At My Compounding Pharmacy, we offer both synthetic and bioidentical hormone medication. As a specialty, our customisable compounded bioidentical hormones can be made in a delivery method that is suitable for you.
                </p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">CHOOSING THE RIGHT DELIVERY METHOD OF BIODENTICAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (BHRT):</h3>
                <p>
                    For those who prefer a convenient and easy way to take. Precise dosing and administration. Suitable for estrogen and progesterone but increase a risk of liver metabolism, gastrointestinal upset and have potential effects on liver function.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    Benefits of compounded capsules can be customised to each patient’s needs in a combination of vegetarian-based capsules and plant-based fillers that are made gelatin-free, dye-free, lactose-free, gluten-free and magnesium stearate-free, making it a more suitable choice.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    <b>Topical Creams and Gels:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Easy to apply and may take time to be absorbed through the skin. Daily application may be less convenient for some patients.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    <b>Transdermal Patches:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patches are another method for continuous hormone delivery and avoid first pass liver metabolism. While not all hormones are suitable in patch form, are visible and require rotation of application site. They may be a suitable form for those unable to swallow and require a single hormone replacement. Monitor for skin irritation or allergies.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    <b>Sublingual Drops / Lozenges:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drops are administered under the tongue for rapid absorption and useful for patient’s who have difficulty with oral medications.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    <b>Suppositories:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some patients may opt for suppositories short term when oral use may not be suitable.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    <b>Injections:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Provide a rapid absorption of hormone. Require a healthcare professional to administer. Useful for patient’s, who have difficulty with oral medications and require less frequent administration of some hormones.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    <b>Pellet Implants:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Provide continuous hormone release over several months, reducing a need for daily administration. They require a minor surgical procedure for insertion, difficult to adjust dosing once implanted and pose a risk to infection or extrusion at the implant site.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">WHY CHOOSE A TROCHES FOR YOUR HRT METHOD:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Precise Dosing:</b> Troches allow for precise dosing adjustments, making it easier to customise your treatment.</li>
                    <li><b>Absorption:</b> Troches are designed to dissolve slowly in the mouth, allowing for direct absorption of hormones through the mucous membranes of the mouth, bypassing the digestive system and avoiding first-pass metabolism in the liver.</li>
                    <li><b>Ease of Administration:</b> Troches are typically easy for patients to administer themselves, as they simply dissolve in the mouth without the need for swallowing pills or injections.</li>
                    <li><b>Convenient for Patients:</b> Patients who have difficulty swallowing pills or who prefer not to use topical creams or gels may find troches to be a convenient alternative.</li>
                    <li><b>Steady Hormone Release:</b> Troches provide a consistent release of hormones over time, helping to maintain stable hormone levels.</li>
                    <li><b>Reduced Risk of Skin Transfer:</b> Unlike topical creams or gels, troches do not carry the risk of transferring hormones to others through skin contact.</li>
                    <li><b>Taste and Sensation:</b> Custom flavouring allows the taste or texture of troches more pleasant to take</li>
                    <li><b>Frequency of Use:</b> Troches are typically administered once-daily or more frequently depending on a person’s dosing requirements</li>
                    <li><b>Storage and Stability:</b> Troches may have specific storage requirements, such as refrigeration, to maintain their stability and effectiveness</li>
                    <li><b>Compliance:</b> Some patients may find taking troches an easy way to remember their medication as opose to taking capsules or applying creams at the required intervals, potentially leading to fluctuations in hormone levels.</li>
                </ol>
